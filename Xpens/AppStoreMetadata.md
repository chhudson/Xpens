## Description (4000 char max)

Xpens makes business expense tracking fast and painless. Snap a photo of any receipt and let built-in OCR automatically extract the amount, date, and merchant name. Categorize, tag, and export professional reports — all without creating an account or sending your data anywhere.

CAPTURE RECEIPTS INSTANTLY
Point your camera at a receipt or import from your photo library. Xpens uses on-device text recognition to pull out the key details so you don't have to type them manually.

ORGANIZE YOUR WAY
Sort expenses into customizable categories with icons and colors, or add freeform tags like "tax-deductible" or "Q1-2026" for flexible filtering. Set up recurring expenses that generate automatically on a weekly, monthly, or yearly schedule.

EXPORT PROFESSIONAL REPORTS
Generate polished PDF reports grouped by category with subtotals, tag breakdowns, and page numbers. Or export to CSV for spreadsheets. Reports bundle with receipt images into a single zip file — ready to send to your accountant.

YOUR DATA, YOUR DEVICE
Xpens is entirely local-first. No accounts, no cloud sync required, no tracking. Optionally back up to iCloud for peace of mind, but your data never leaves your control.
